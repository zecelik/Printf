# Printf
 Project - Implementation of the printf Function in C
This project focuses on creating my own version of the printf function in the C programming language. The printf function is a widely used and essential function for formatted output. By implementing my own printf function, I aim to demonstrate a deep understanding of C programming, string manipulation, and the inner workings of the printf function.
